# ⚡ **Salve Surya Raj**

### *Builder. Problem Solver. System Thinker.*

### *I craft scalable apps, intuitive experiences, and reliable systems.*

## 🧩 **Who I Am (Beyond Code)**

I started as a curious kid who loved building things — mechanical inventions first (I won **2 international gold medals** and **4 national gold medals** in innovation at 15).
Now that same spark fuels my journey in **software engineering**, where I combine creativity, engineering discipline, and insane persistence to build things that *scale*.

Today I’m a:

* **Freelancer** who delivers complete products (apps, SaaS platforms, e-commerce systems, booking portals, fintech workflows, dashboards).
* **ML & System Design Enthusiast** preparing for the road to becoming a **scalable systems architect**.
* **Hackathon Winner** (YUVA Hackathon @ RGUKT Basar, Siemens Tech For Society 2025).
* **Builder who ships** — not just experiments.

I don’t wait for the “right time.”
I build. Every. Single. Day.

## 🛠️ **What I Build**

I’ve created systems across multiple domains:

### **📦 Logistics**

* *parcelhorse.com*
* Courier/parcel management platforms
* Delivery workflow automations

### **🛒 E-commerce & Retail**

* E-commerce stores
* Catalog engines
* Cart + Inventory + Payment integrations

### **📱 Mobile Apps**

* **ShotOK** (Android app)
* Several Flutter & React Native products for clients

### **💼 SaaS Platforms**

* Cashback platform
* Booking management system
* School management system (microservices + Redis + email pipelines)
* Journaling + Neuroplasticity platform

### **📊 Tools & Dashboards**

* Scorecard systems
* Admin dashboards
* Analytics visualizations

**Everything I build has one common goal:**
✨ *It must scale elegantly.*

## 🧠 **What I’m Pursuing Now**

My north star is simple:

### **Become a Scalable System Architect**

To reach that, I’m learning and practicing:

* **System Design** — load balancing, caching, queues, replicas, fault tolerance
* **Backend Engineering** — Spring Boot, FastAPI, microservices
* **Machine Learning** — the math + intuition + deployment side
* **DevOps** — Docker, CI/CD, cloud, automation pipelines

I don’t want to just know ML or backend —
I want to *engineer ecosystems* that handle real-world scale.

## 🚀 **Active Learning Projects**

These are not “courses.”
They’re **engineering journeys** I’m documenting week-by-week.

### **📘 ML Learning Journey →** From NumPy to full pipelines

### **🏗 System Design Journey →** Designing scalable architectures

### **⚙ DevOps Journey →** Deployments, CI/CD, and automation

Each repo grows like a story — chapter by chapter.

## 🧭 **What Drives Me**

* I build because solving problems feels like breathing.
* I love systems that behave like living organisms — stable, adaptive, scalable.
* I believe code becomes beautiful when it survives real users.
